# Worklog

### 08/10/25
Work done: 
- Detect changes in PROJECT.md. Overwrite in the target directory.
- Detect changes in WORKLOG.md. It will parse date subtitles and their items, then
create a file for each.

Errors:
 - Since the last change to parse by date, it is not generating the branch and 
 PR in the target repo.
