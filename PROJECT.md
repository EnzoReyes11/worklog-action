# Project & Worklog Sync Action

A reusable GitHub Action that automatically syncs `WORKLOG.md` and `PROJECT.md` files from multiple source repositories to a single, centralized repository. 
I use it to maintain a portfolio and blog in Astro. 

- `PROJECT.md` are the portfolio files, describing the overall project. 
- `WORKLOG.md` are the blog files. The content should have date items, which will be parsed by the read platform.

## Backlog

- Investigate how to configure the action on a private repo.
