# Worklog

### 08/10/25
Work done: 
- Tried having PROJECT and WORKLOG files with different behaviors. WORKLOG would 
be parsed and different date items would create different files. But I'm discarding this
solution. Instead I'm going to create just one file for the WORKLOG and one for PROJECT.
Then, the Astro blog would parse WORKLOG and create the different blog posts programmatically.
- Detect both PROJECT and WORKLOG changes. Overwrite into target destination.
- TEST 3
