# Project & Worklog Sync Action

A reusable GitHub Action that automatically syncs `WORKLOG.md` and `PROJECT.md` files from multiple source repositories to a single, centralized repository. 
I use it to maintain a portfolio and blog in Astro. 

- `PROJECT.md` are the portfolio files, describing the overall project. 
- `WORKLOG.md` are the blog files. It looks for the latest date and adds that into the content.
